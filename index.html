        <h1>Chloe Peters</h1>
        <h2>Freshman from New Hampshire</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University majoring in International Studies with minors in Psychology and a Modern Language. I work as an Alumni Relations student ambassador for the University and as a custodial worker. I also work part-time as a Respite Care Attendant in Virginia.</p>
         <p>
            I began college with an undeclared major, trying to decide between the realms of Guidance Counseling, Performance, or Political Science. Because of this, I participated in many extra-curricular opportunities to help narrow down my options. I became a part of multiple organizations on campus, including the International Student Organization, the Public Policy Organization, and the debate club. I also enjoy theatre. I was in the Matchmaker last semester and we just finished Living Gallery performances last week. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I enjoy picking up new hobbies. I've done just about every odd thing you can imagine - or at least tried it.
